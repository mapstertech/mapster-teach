    /*

    Example from Mapster dealing with filters on maps
    Exclusive, inclusive, and nested categories

    */

    var map = new maplibregl.Map({
        container: 'map', // container id
        style: 'https://demotiles.maplibre.org/style.json', // style URL
        center: [0, 0], // starting position [lng, lat]
        zoom: 1 // starting zoom
    });

    // This is an example using jQuery, but doing this with React would probably be a little simpler
    // since you wouldn't have to do as much DOM manipulation
    // The principles are the same

		// We need to organize a "key" for the categories, so we can display and know the hierarchy
    // Getting a geoJSON of the things we're mapping and putting them on the map

    // Building the control with the checkboxes
		// Each HTML element should have a way of indicating to the function its ID as well as its parent (if any)
		// Toggling child checkbox visibility is optional

    // Listening for any changes in any of the checkboxes

    	// On a change, review ALL the checkboxes

			// Check if their parents are completely without child checkboxes (if so, auto-uncheck them)
			// Or, any children, auto-check or uncheck

			// Build an array of "inactiveToggles" IDs or terms
			// Loop over your features and build an array of "features to hide"
				// Note the differences here in "exclusive" vs "inclusive" filtering

			// Adjust the mapbox features
			// Markers and symbols are done differently
